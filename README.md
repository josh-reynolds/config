# config
Collecting various configuration files in one place. Inspiration comes from playing around with tmux; I don't want to lose the setup (and I'm getting into vim customization too, so...). Probably not the best way to do this, but at least I'll have a retrievable copy stashed somewhere safe if I need to rebuild.
